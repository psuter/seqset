# SeqSet

A minimal/work-in-progress implementation of data structures encoding sets of
sequences. Includes implementations of a
[Trie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie) and of
[DFA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deterministic_finite_automaton)s and
[NFA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nondeterministic_finite_automaton).

All data structures are immutable from an observer's point of view and support
equality testing.
